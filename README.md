# FreeCodeCamp Survey Form Project

This project is a part of my FreeCodeCamp journey to learn web development. It's a survey form created with HTML and styled with CSS.

## Project Overview

- **HTML:** The structure of the survey form is defined using HTML. It includes input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a submit button.

- **CSS:** CSS is used to style the form, making it visually appealing. You can modify the CSS to match your preferred design.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the survey form.
3. Feel free to make any modifications or enhancements.
